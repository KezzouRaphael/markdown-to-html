#### A funny story

 I was on a trip with my family in Spain, there were : me, my brother, our parents and our dog.
 
 As almost always in Spain, it was very hot that day and so we decided to rest at a nearby park where there were some animals (ducks mostly), 
 I was walking the dog on the leash when suddently I sneezed and let go of the leash, my dog then started to rush after the ducks 
 and I had to make the run to  grab it before it hurts those poor ducks.
 
###### TL;DR Don't sneeze when you're walking your dog out
